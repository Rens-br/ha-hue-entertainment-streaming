Drive a Philips Hue **entertainment area** from Home Assistant: colours,
animated scenes that move through the room, and live control from your own
programs using the fast stream the Hue Sync apps use: about 50 updates a second to the bridge, which updates the lights about 25 times a second.

![panel](<docs/images/panel.png>)

## What you get
- **Home Assistant entities** an Entertainment light (with the scenes as effects), the area, scene speed and an allow-override setting.
- **A sidebar panel** to pick the entertainment area, turn sync on and off, see a live 3D-style view of the room with every light in its place and colour, paint lights, and play scenes with their own settings.
- **Animated scenes** that use where your lights are: a sweep across the room, aurora curtains, a thunderstorm with lightning that rolls through the room.
Write your own as JSON files.
- **Actions** for automations: set colours per light (or draw an overlay on top of a running scene, for example as a notification), play and stop scenes.
- **Live control** for your own programs (visualisers, games, training apps) over Home Assistant's WebSocket.
- **Plays nicely with a Hue Sync Box**: starting while another app syncs gives a clear "busy" message, and when another app takes over, sync turns off instead of fighting back. Optionally allow taking over.

## Planned features
The following features are currently planned to be added, but might change in the future:
- **Custom light positioning:** Allowing to change the light positions from the panel, to be able to place them better, and enable more support for non-square rooms.
- **Non-entertainment zone lights:** Allowing to add lights that are not in the entertainment zone, while they would be more restricted. (using normal light commands, which the bridge limits to about 10 updates a second)
- **Additional scene features:** Brightness layers to control brightness from noise.
- **Scene sharing:** A scene browser within home-assistant or another easier way to find and share scenes. 
- **Multiple bridges:** Allowing to add multiple bridges, allowing for larger entertainment zones if possible.

## Requirements

- A Philips Hue bridge with at least one **entertainment area**, created in the Hue app under Settings, Entertainment areas. The area also sets where each light is in the room.
- Home Assistant. Developed and tested on **2026.10** (Home Assistant OS).
- Home Assistant and the bridge on the same network.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open this repository in HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=Rens-br&repository=ha-hue-entertainment-streaming&category=integration)

Or by hand:

1. In HACS, search for **Philips Hue Entertainment Streaming** and download it.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

1. Copy `custom_components/ha_hue_entertainment` into your Home Assistant
   `config/custom_components/` folder.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up Philips Hue Entertainment Streaming.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=ha_hue_entertainment)

1. Go to **Settings, Devices and services**. Your bridge usually shows up as a discovered **Philips Hue Entertainment Streaming** card; otherwise use **Add integration** and search for it. If the bridge isn't found, enter its IP address.
2. Press the round **link button** on the bridge and select **Submit** within 30 seconds.
3. Open **Hue Entertainment** in the sidebar (admins only) and pick your entertainment area.

This integration pairs with the bridge separately from Home Assistant's built-in
Hue integration; both can be used side by side.

## The panel
- **Sync** and **Allow override** toggles.
- **Room view**: the area like in the Hue app, with each light on a pole at its height and gradient lights as bars, coloured live. Pick a colour and select a light (or a part of a gradient light) to paint it; set the overall brightness.
- **Scenes**: play and stop, speed, and a settings form for the selected scene.

## Entities

Per bridge (entity ids depend on your bridge's name):

| Entity | What it does |
|---|---|
| `light.<bridge>_entertainment` | On: sync on, showing its colour or scene. Off: sync off, the lights return to how they were. Colour and brightness apply to the whole area. Scenes are its **effects**. The `channels` attribute lists each channel id and its light. |
| `select.<bridge>_entertainment_zone` | The entertainment area to use. Switching while syncing moves the stream. |
| `number.<bridge>_scene_speed` | Speed of the playing scene (0.1 to 4×). |
| `switch.<bridge>_allow_override` | Configuration: let starting sync stop another app’s stream, such as a Hue Sync Box. Off by default. |

While syncing, the bridge reserves the area's lights for the stream; the Hue
app, scenes and Home Assistant's Hue integration can't change them until sync
stops. When sync stops, the bridge puts them back as they were.

## Actions

### `ha_hue_entertainment.set_colors`

Set colours per channel and/or for the whole area. Starts sync if it's off.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `channels` | Colour per channel id (see the light's `channels` attribute). Channels not listed keep their colour. |
| `all` | One colour for every channel, applied before `channels`. |
| `brightness_pct` | Brightness of the whole area, 0 to 100. |
| `overlay` | Draw on top of a running scene or live client instead of replacing it. |
| `duration` | Remove the overlay after this many seconds. |
| `clear_overlay` | Remove all overlays first. |

Colours are `[r, g, b]` (0 to 255), `[r, g, b, brightness]` where the 4th value
(0 to 255) dims that colour, `"#rrggbb"` or `"#rrggbbBB"`.

```yaml
action: ha_hue_entertainment.set_colors
target:
  entity_id: light.pro_bridge_entertainment
data:
  all: [255, 120, 0, 60]
  channels:
    0: [255, 0, 0]
    3: "#00ff00"
```

### `ha_hue_entertainment.play_scene`

Play a scene, optionally with its own settings. Starts sync if it's off.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `scene` | Scene id or name, for example `sweep`. |
| `params` | Scene settings; anything not given keeps its default. |
| `speed` | Speed, 0.1 to 4. Also sets the Scene speed entity. |

```yaml
action: ha_hue_entertainment.play_scene
target:
  entity_id: light.pro_bridge_entertainment
data:
  scene: sweep
  params:
    color: "#0050ff"
    bounce: true
  speed: 1.5
```

The quickest way to play a scene with its default settings is the light's effect:

```yaml
action: light.turn_on
target:
  entity_id: light.pro_bridge_entertainment
data:
  effect: Aurora
```

### `ha_hue_entertainment.stop_scene`

Stop the scene. The lights keep its last frame and sync stays on; turn the
Entertainment light off to stop sync.

## Scenes (animations)

> **Further development**: the scenes feature is very basic allowing for some animated scenes already, but is one of the areas I want to focus on most when the base is solid, allowing for even more advanced effects.

There is a couple of built in scenes that are shipped with the integration, these are meant as demo scenes and can change later on: **Sweep** (a band of colour travelling across the room), **Aurora**
(slow green, teal and violet curtains) and **Thunderstorm** (dark clouds with
lightning that strikes somewhere and rolls through the room).

> Some scenes, like Thunderstorm, flash. If anyone is sensitive to flashing light, avoid them.

**Your own scenes** are JSON files in `config/ha_hue_entertainment/scenes/` (the
folder is created on setup). They are read at startup and can be reloaded from the panel, a scene with the same `id` as a built-in replaces it, and invalid
files are skipped with the reason in the log.

New scenes can be uploaded from the panel, and user uploaded scenes can be deleted from here as well.

A scene has settings (`parameters`) and `layers` that compute each light's
colour from its position in the room and the time:

```json
{
  "format": 1,
  "id": "music-flow",
  "name": "Music flow",
  "parameters": {
    "color_1": {"type": "color", "default": "#ff2d95"},
    "color_2": {"type": "color", "default": "#7b2cff"},
    "flow": {"type": "number", "default": 0.08, "min": 0.01, "max": 0.5}
  },
  "layers": [
    {"type": "noise", "colors": ["$color_1", "$color_2"], "scale": 1.2, "drift": "$flow"}
  ]
}
```

Layer types: `solid`, `gradient`, `band`, `noise` and `flash`, combined with
`normal`, `add` or `max` blending. The full format is described at the top of
[`core/scenes.py`](custom_components/ha_hue_entertainment/core/scenes.py), and
the [built-in scenes](custom_components/ha_hue_entertainment/scenes) are
examples to start from.

## External clients

Your own programs can claim control and stream colours in real time over Home
Assistant's WebSocket, using a token of a dedicated non-admin user. See
[docs/EXTERNAL_CLIENTS.md](docs/EXTERNAL_CLIENTS.md).

## Automation examples

Flash the light next to the front door red for 5 seconds when the doorbell
rings, on top of whatever is playing:

```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.doorbell
    to: "on"
actions:
  - action: ha_hue_entertainment.set_colors
    target:
      entity_id: light.pro_bridge_entertainment
    data:
      channels:
        4: [255, 0, 0]
      overlay: true
      duration: 5
```

Start the thunderstorm when a movie starts after sunset:

```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: media_player.living_room_tv
    to: playing
conditions:
  - condition: sun
    after: sunset
actions:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.pro_bridge_entertainment
    data:
      effect: Thunderstorm
```

## Known limitations

- **One stream per bridge.** While a Hue Sync Box, the Hue Sync app or another app streams, this integration can't (unless **Allow override** is on), and the other way round.
- **Gradient lights** get as many controllable parts as the bridge gives them channels in the entertainment area, which can be fewer than the light's segments.
- **Positions** come from the entertainment area in the Hue app; scenes and the room view are only as accurate as that setup.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Bridge is busy: … is syncing"**: another app (often a Hue Sync Box) holds the bridge. Stop it, or turn on **Allow override**.
- **The bridge isn't found**: make sure Home Assistant and the bridge are on the same network, or enter the bridge's IP address during setup.
- **Sync turns itself off**: another app took over the bridge, or the area was stopped in the Hue app. The panel shows the reason.
- **Debug logging**: on the integration's page, select **Enable debug logging**, reproduce the problem, then disable it to download the log. Or in
  `configuration.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  logger:
    logs:
      custom_components.ha_hue_entertainment: debug
  ```

Report problems on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Rens-br/ha-hue-entertainment-streaming/issues).

## Development

- `custom_components/ha_hue_entertainment/core/`: bridge (discovery, pairing, CLIP v2), stream (HueStream v2 over DTLS with pyOpenSSL), engine, scenes. No Home Assistant imports, so the [standalone server](docs/STANDALONE.md) uses the same code.
- The panel is TypeScript + Lit in `frontend/`, built into `custom_components/ha_hue_entertainment/frontend/panel.js` (committed, so installing needs no build step):

  ```bash
  cd frontend && npm ci
  npm run build    # type-check and build panel.js
  npm run lint     # ESLint + Prettier
  ```

- Python is checked with `ruff check` and `ruff format` (config in `pyproject.toml`). CI runs these, hassfest and the HACS validator.
